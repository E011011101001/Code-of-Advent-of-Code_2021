# My Solutions for [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021)

Just a repo to record my work solving the AoC 2021 challenges. They are definitely not the best solutions, and may not even be good solutions.

But they work!

The solutions before day 8 are lost. Only after I cleared up my day 7 solutions and started to use the same file to code the day 8 solutions, just as I always did, did I begin to realize that I could have posted them all up on Github. Shame, indeed.
